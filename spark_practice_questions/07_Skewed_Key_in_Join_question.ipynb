    "- One or two tasks take **much longer** than others\n",

    "1. **Read** both skewed transaction datasets.\n",
    "2. **Detect skewed keys** by analyzing record counts per `customer_id`.\n",

    "- Both datasets are large and distributed across the cluster.\n",
    "- A small number of `customer_id`s are extremely frequent (hot keys).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Spark distributes work **by key** during joins.\n",
    "- If one key has far more records, **one task gets overloaded**.\n",
    "- Skew causes:\n",
