    "\n",
    "You own a **daily Spark batch job** that aggregates total sales by region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially:\n",
    "- Runtime ≈ **15 minutes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time:\n",
    "- Runtime slowly increased to **2 hours**\n",
    "\n",
    "No single change caused the slowdown — instead, it happened gradually as:\n",
    "- Data volume increased\n",
    "- More historical data accumulated\n",
    "- Inefficient read patterns became more expensive\n",
    "- Shuffle-heavy operations started processing much more data\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **very common real-world problem** in batch data pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to:\n",
    "- **Diagnose** the performance bottlenecks using Spark UI\n",
    "- **Optimize** the job so it continues to scale as data grows\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use **Spark UI** to identify where the job is slow.\n",
    "2. Determine whether the job is:\n",
    "   - reading too much data\n",
    "   - performing large or unnecessary shuffles\n",
    "   - affected by data skew\n",
    "3. Apply **code-level optimizations** to:\n",
    "   - reduce the amount of data scanned\n",
    "   - reduce shuffle cost during aggregation\n",
    "   - use efficient storage formats\n",
    "4. Validate that the optimized job processes **only the required day’s data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- The job runs **once per day** for a single `process_date`.\n",
    "- Historical sales data is stored in **cloud object storage**.\n",
    "- Data volume **grows continuously** as new days are added.\n",
    "- Spark Serverless or classic Spark clusters may be used.\n",
    "- No changes were made to business logic — only data volume increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **optimized daily aggregation job** that scales with growing data.\n",
    "- Aggregated output containing **total sales by region for a single day**.\n",
    "- A clear demonstration of **performance improvement** compared to the naive approach.\n",

    "## 🧠 Notes \n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance problems usually appear **gradually** as data grows, not suddenly.\n",
    "- Always start optimization by **observing Spark UI**, not changing code blindly.\n",
    "- The biggest performance wins usually come from **reading less data**, not adding more compute.\n",
    "- Using **Parquet or Delta** enables:\n",
    "  - column pruning\n",
    "  - predicate pushdown\n",
    "- Partitioning data by frequently filtered columns (such as `order_date`) enables **partition pruning**.\n",
    "- Code that works well for small datasets may **fail to scale** without these optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 Tip:  \n",
    "> If a batch job becomes slower over time, assume a **data growth and data layout problem first**, not a Spark bug.\n",
